The intended experience is already configured in the default options. Preferably merely adjust render distance, simulation distance or graphical settings. Messing with configurations may lead to unintended results
I recommend allocating up to 8GBs of RAM on memory settings for a comfortable performance. Use of the Chunky mod (chunk pre-generation mod) is advised after loading into a world.
All resource packs are part of the core experience and enhance the gameplay experience drastically, although are optional in case frame rates are non-optimal.
